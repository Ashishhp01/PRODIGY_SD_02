## 🧩 **About the Project**

This is a simple yet engaging **Python-based Number Guessing Game** 🎮  
The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the user has to guess it.  

After each guess, the program provides feedback:
- 📈 “Too high!” — if your guess is greater than the target  
- 📉 “Too low!” — if your guess is smaller than the target  

The game continues until you guess correctly, and then displays the number of attempts you took to win 🏆

## 🧠 **Features**
✅ Random number generation  
✅ Dynamic feedback after each guess  
✅ Input validation (handles non-integer values)  
✅ Attempt counter  
✅ Option to play multiple rounds  
✅ Beginner-friendly and well-structured Python code

## 🧰 **Tech Stack**
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `random` — for number generation  
  - `try-except` — for input validation and error handling
